                                    <p>Person Registry was an assignment i got give while doing my C# course.<br>
                                        We were to create a program where you could add users to a registry with a graphical interface.<br>
                                        Project required features:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><dt>An Add-button</dt><dd>Clicking 'Add' would create a user with the first and lastname from the boxes, and gender from the radio buttons.<br>
                                            Created users endup in the Persons listbox with a prefix telling their gender.</dd></li>
                                            <li><dt>Remove-button</dt><dd>Remove button removes all selected users from the registry.</dd></li>
                                            <li><dt>Merge function</dt><dd>Merge function is used to make child of the two people of different genders that are selected.<br>
                                            First name is inherited from the mother and last name from the father.</dd></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        App also has some error handling when typing first/lastname, trying ot merge more than two people and people of the same gender.</p>

                            <h2>Practice: Files</h2>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="column">
                                   <p>This Files assignment was only practice opportunity, but I 'finished' it ahead of the deadline and i gave it my own touch and challenged myself.<br>
                                    The assignment was to make a program that creates a text-file with the numbers 1-100, one number per row.<br>
                                    Second part of the assignment was to make a program that would open the text-file and write all its content in the console.<br>
                                    After completing the first half and reading the second part. I asked the teacher if i could put the two parts together.<br>
                                    They approved. And i got to work with combining the two into on application, which i did in 15 minuts.<br>
                                    I then added a menu that the user could maneuver though with the arrow keys and added some othat fancy options like:<br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Adding number to a file</li>
                                        <li>Writing content from file to console</li>
                                        <li>Open the text-file</li>
                                        <li>Delete the file</li>
                                        <li>And close the program</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    After this I was happy with the result and handed it in</p>
